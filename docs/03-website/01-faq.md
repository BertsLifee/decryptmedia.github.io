## Creating an Account

### Problem: I canâ€™t create an account

#### I can't enter an email account

* If you are trying to enter an email account and the creation button is inactive, please double-check  that you input your address correctly.
* If you've already created an account, you're in the wrong place. Go back to the Log In option on the Menu and access your account that way.

#### I can't confirm my email

We use [Magic links](https://magic.link) to verify your emails, so instead of a password, we send a link to your inbox.
To ensure this process works smoothly, please follow these steps:

* Enter your email account in the Decrypt app.
* Open the corresponding email account in your mobile Inbox (If the Magic Link is not in your Inbox, please check your spam folder).
* In the Magic Link email, click: "Log into Decrypt." You should be directed to a web browser screen to confirm the process. This is not the final login step!
* Go back to the Decrypt app and wait for a PIN request to appear.  This is the last step in verifying your account's and is an indicator that the log in was a success.

ðŸ’¡**Note:** Logging into to the app is supported on mobile phones only. The link will expire after 10 minutes.

#### Iâ€™m getting an error

Occasionally you may see errors stating API or OST connection issues. These mean weâ€™re having some technical difficulties. We are notified about them and are working to resolve them.We'll be posting real-time updates on these issues in our [Discord server](https://decrypt.co/discord-invite), if you want to catch up on the fixes.

ðŸ’¡**Troubleshooting tip:** We release app updates frequently, sometimes several times a week. If all else fails, try deleting the app and reinstalling it to see if that allows you to sign in.

## Logging into the Decrypt account

### Problem: I canâ€™t log in

#### I get a message that my email address is not recognized

Please ensure you are using the same email you signed up with. Our policy permits only one email account per device.
